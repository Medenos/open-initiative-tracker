	<h2>About this project</h2>
	<p>
		I'm a dungeon master on D&D 5e and I like using my PC to track initiative and other information while in combat encounters. It helps make the whole ordeal way faster and simpler for me and my players. However, I find current web based option like <a
			href="https://kastark.co.uk/rpgs/encounter-tracker/"
			target="_blank">Encounter Initiative Tracker</a
		>, whilst useful and well made, kind of lacking in some features I would like to have. Open Initiative Tracker is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software" target="_blank">open-source</a> attempt at adding these features I think would
		be nice
